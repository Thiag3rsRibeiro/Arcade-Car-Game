# Arcade-Car-Game

A car game built in HTML, CSS, and Javascript with a concept inspired by 1980s arcade games. You start the game by pressing the 'Play' button, and it will begin. You can stop it by pressing the 'Stop' button. Some improvements need to be implemented, such as a score system, making the chain of enemy cars more random, and increasing their velocity as time passes.
